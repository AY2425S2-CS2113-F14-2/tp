# User Guide

## Introduction

CEGStudyBuddy is a desktop application that tracks and plans university courses efficiently for NUS Computer Engineering students who want a structured academic roadmap. It helps to optimise workload, ensure graduation requirements, and keep students organised with ease.

This application is designed to be optimised for a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you are a fast typer, you can plan and track your courses faster than NUSMods.
