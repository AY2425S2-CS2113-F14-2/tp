# JinbaoAlex's Project Portfolio Page

CEGStudyBuddy is a desktop application that tracks and plans university courses efficiently for NUS Computer Engineering students who want a structured academic roadmap.  
It helps to optimise workload, ensure graduation requirements, and keep students organised with ease, while managing multiple scenarios and possible schedules in their academic journey.

Below are my contributions to the project.
